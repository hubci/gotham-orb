***This orb has been superceded by [HubCI/strawberry](https://github.com/hubci/strawberry-orb).***

This orb allows you to easily install and use Gotham (or Hugo) on CircleCI.
Gotham is a static site generator used to build fast, efficient, and secure websites from Markdown files.
Gotham is a soft fork of Hugo and is 99% compatible so this orb will work to build, test, and deploy both Gotham and Hugo websites.

Built-in testing is done with HTML Proofer.
This orb includes an executor but works with Linux and macOS images.
